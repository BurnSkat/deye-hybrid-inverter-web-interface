# SolarHub: Web Interface for Deye Hybrid Inverter

SolarHub is a fully integrated web-based interface designed for the Deye / Sunsync 3-Phase Hybrid Solar Inverter (6kW, 8kW, 10kW, 12kW). The system continuously collects and stores critical data from the inverter at a high frequency. Through the responsive web interface, users can monitor real-time information, view historical data, and analyze important statistics.

### Features

1. Real-time monitoring of power generation, consumption battery status, grid imports and exports and so on.
2. Visualization of historical data.
3. Easy Integration into HomeAssistant for Automation using the API via http endpoints (live data in JSON format at `<server>/api/live/raw` - more details soon)
4. Configurable battery charge and discharge limits to extend battery lifespan.
5. Mobile-friendly, responsive and fool-proof design.
6. Automatic Wi-Fi access point creation when the connection is lost, allowing users to connect the system to a new network via the web interface.
7. Periodic database backups to a USB stick when plugged into the Raspberry Pi.
8. Notifications about your system via Telegram Channel.
9. Additional features planned for future updates (e.g. locales.json for adding languages, more statistics, etc)

# Prerequisites

1. **Raspberry Pi** – Tested on the Raspberry Pi 3B+, but should be compatible with other models.
2. **USB to RS485 Converter & RJ45 Cable** – Required for the serial connection between the Raspberry Pi and the Deye Inverter. [This converter](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B09SB85W3J?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) from Amazon was used, but others should work as well.
3. **USB SSD** – While optional, using an SSD for booting the Raspberry Pi is recommended. It enhances speed, reliability, and extends the system’s lifespan, as most SD cards and USB sticks may not withstand continuous use over several years.
4. **RJ-45 Cable** - This is just a standard Ethernet "LAN" cable which will be used for the serial connection between the Deye Inverter and the Raspberry Pi.

# Setup Guide

In this section, we'll walk you through the hardware and software setup for SolarHub, step by step. Even if you're new to working with Raspberry Pi or setting up solar inverters, this guide is designed to be easy to follow.

### Hardware Setup

1. **Prepare the RJ45 Cable:**

   -  Start by cutting off one end of the Ethernet cable to expose the internal wires.
   -  Inside the cable, you will find eight small wires. For this setup, we only need three of these wires: one for ground (GND) and two for data (A and B).

2. **Connect the Wires to the RS485 Converter:**

   -  Look at the wires from the RJ45 cable and identify the correct ones using the pinout guide below. Connect those to the RS485-USB converter as specified.
      -  **Pin 6:** This wire will be the ground connection and connects to the **GND** terminal on the RS485-USB converter.
      -  **Pin 7:** This wire carries the positive data signal and connects to the **A** terminal on the RS485-USB converter.
      -  **Pin 8:** This wire carries the negative data signal and connects to the **B** terminal on the RS485-USB converter.

3. **Connect the RS485 Converter to the Inverter:**

   -  Once the wires are connected to the RS485 converter, plug the other end of the RJ45 cable into the "Modbus" port on the Deye Inverter.
   -  Plug the USB-End of the RS485 converter into the Raspberry Pi.
   -  Ensure that all connections are correct and secure. If everything is connected correctly, the hardware setup is complete.

### Software Setup

Now that your hardware is set up, we can move on to setting up the software on the Raspberry Pi.

1. **Prepare the SSD:**

   -  To begin, you'll need to install the Raspberry Pi OS Lite on your SSD. If you haven't already, download the [Raspberry Pi Imager tool](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) on your computer. This tool works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
   -  Connect the USB-SSD to your computer.
   -  Open the Raspberry Pi Imager, select "Raspberry Pi OS Lite" as the operating system, and choose your SSD as the storage device. For performance reasons it is recommended to use the 32-Bit version for the Pi 3B+ and older.
   -  Configure SSH (enable SSH) and Wi-Fi (enter your Wi-Fi credentials). This will allow you to set up the Raspberry Pi without needing to connect a keyboard, mouse, or monitor (a "headless" setup).
   -  You will also need to configure a username and a password.
   -  Click "Write" and wait for the process to complete.

2. **Start the Raspberry Pi:**

   -  Once the Raspberry Pi OS is installed, remove the SSD from your computer and insert it into your Raspberry Pi.
   -  Power on the Raspberry Pi. If you’ve configured everything correctly, it should connect to your Wi-Fi network after approximately 5 Minutes.

3. **Access the Raspberry Pi via SSH:**

   -  If you’re using a Windows machine, you can use [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) to connect to your Raspberry Pi via SSH. On macOS and Linux, you can use the Terminal application.
   -  Open your SSH client and connect to your Raspberry Pi using the IP address of your Pi (you can find this in your router’s device list if you’re not sure). The command to connect via SSH will look something like this:
      ```bash
      ssh <your-username>@<your-pi-ip-address>
      ssh merlin@192.168.1.114
      ```
   -  Replace `<your-username>` with the username you set in the imager tool and `<your-pi-ip-address>` with the actual IP address. You will be asked for your password.

4. **Clone the SolarHub Repository:**

   -  Now that you’re connected to your Raspberry Pi, clone the SolarHub repository by running the following command:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/MerlinHof/deye-hybrid-inverter-web-interface.git
      ```
   -  This command will download all the necessary files and scripts to your Raspberry Pi.

5. **Run the Setup Script:**

   -  Navigate to the directory where the repository was cloned to:
      ```bash
      cd deye-hybrid-inverter-web-interface
      ```
   -  Run the setup script with superuser permissions:
      ```bash
      sudo python3 setup.py
      ```
   -  The setup script will install all necessary dependencies and configure your system. This may take a few minutes.
   -  Once the setup script has finished, your Raspberry Pi should be ready to interact with the Deye Hybrid Inverter. You can now access the web interface by entering the IP address of your Raspberry Pi into a web browser on any device connected to the same network.

Congratulations! You've successfully set up SolarHub. You can now start monitoring your solar inverter in real-time, view historical data, and adjust settings as needed. If you encounter any issues, don't hesitate to reach out to the community for support.
